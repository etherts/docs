# Ethereum-AssemblyScript project

The Ethereum-AssemblyScript project (`etherts` for short) aims to develop a robust set of tools to allow the development, testing, and deployment of Ethereum smart contracts using AssemblyScript.

[AssemblyScript](https://github.com/AssemblyScript/assemblyscript) is a subset of TypeScript, a flavor of strictly-typed JavaScript. It compiles directly to "lean, mean WebAssembly modules." It should look and feel quite similar to any JavaScript developer, and is also a natural fit for Wasm since the Wasm runtime is based on the JavaScript runtime. It also uses existing JavaScript tooling such as `npm`.
